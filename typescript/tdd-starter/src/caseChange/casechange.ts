   * You first locate and extract the first letter of that string by using its index.

   * indexing in JavaScript (and most programming languages) starts at 0,
   * so the first letter has an index of 0.
   *
   * Save this operation in a new variable called capFirstLetter.
   *
   * Next, you want to isolate and cut off that first character and keep the remainder of the string.
   * One way to do this is by using the slice() method. This creates a new string starting from the
   * index specified until the end of the word.You want to start from the second letter until the end
   * of the value. In this case, the argument you should pass to slice() is an index of 1
   * since that is the index of the second letter.
   *
   * This way, the first character is excluded altogether. A new string is returned without it but
   * containing the rest of the characters â€“ minus that first letter. Then save that operation to a new variable.
   *
   * @param str
   * @returns {str}
