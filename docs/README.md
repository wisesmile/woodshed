# Woodshed projects

The woodshed repository consists of code that I have written in order to test and explore various tools, libraries and concepts relevant to me as a developer and to keep a running single repo of all the experiments.  I had originally used this same methodology in the hills repo, but that did contain code written by others.  

- Javascript unit testing with Jest
- Learning typescript
- Exploring Vue
- React.js with Docker
