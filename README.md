# woodshed

This is a collection of code examples, snippets and experiments with technology that I'm currently investigating or exploring as part of my technical work.

I started this process a long time back with the repo hills, which is still available here. Hills incorporated sample code from others, and it's got a lot of old code in there that is no longer relevant.

## git config

git config --global --unset user.email
git config --global --unset user.name
